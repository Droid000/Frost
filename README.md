# About the Bot
Frost is a [Discord](https://discord.com/) bot that helps you express your feelings towards someone else.

# Installation 
You'll need to have [discordrb](https://github.com/shardlab/discordrb) installed on your computer. Once you've installed discordrb, type in ```gem install dotenv```. You may have to install this with sudo or admin privileges. 


Once you've installed both gems, create a file called ```.env``` add this line to it: ```BOT_TOKEN=TOKEN_HERE```. Replace ```TOKEN_HERE``` with your bots actual token. Once that's done simply change your directory in your terminal to be the same as your bot file and type in: ```ruby frost.rb``` to run the bot.

# Privacy Policy
Discord requires me to have one of these. There isn't much to say. The bot doesn't store any member or guild data.

# Terms of Service
Once again, I'm required to have one of these. Just follow Discord's terms of service. If you don't like the bot, simply don't use it. 

# Acknowledgements 
First and foremost, thank you to Dyna for finding the vast majority of the GIFs the bot uses. Additionally, Shout out to Thanos for inspiring me with his bot and being the person who got me interested in bot development.
