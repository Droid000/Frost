# About the Bot
Frost is a small Discord bot that helps you express your feelings towards someone else.

# Installation 
You'll need to have discordrb installed on your computer. Once you've installed discordrb, you can open the main.rb file in an IDE such as Visual Studio Code and replace the ```token:``` value with your bot's token. Make sure the bot's token value is enclosed in quotation marks. Do not ever share this token with anyone else. 

# Acknowledgements 
Shout out to Thanos for inspiring me with his own bot and being the person who got me interested in bot development.
