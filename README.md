# About the Bot
Frost is a small [Discord](https://discord.com/) bot that helps you express your feelings towards someone else.

# Installation 
You'll need to have [discordrb](https://github.com/shardlab/discordrb) installed on your computer. Once you've installed discordrb, you can open the main.rb file in an IDE such as Visual Studio Code and replace the ```token:``` value with your bot's token. Make sure the bot's token value is enclosed in quotation marks. Do not ever share this token with anyone else.

Once you've set the bot token, open your operating system's terminal or command-line interface and ```cd``` into the directory where the main.rb file is located. On Windows, this can be done by right-clicking on the file and choosing ```copy file path```. Once you've correctly changed your directory, simply type in: ```ruby main.rb``` and your bot should come online! 

# Privacy Policy
Discord requires me to have one of these. There isn't much to say. The bot doesn't store any user or guild data.

# Terms of Service
Once again, I'm required to have one of these. Just follow Discord's terms of service. If you don't like the bot, just don't use it. 

# Acknowledgements 
First and foremost, thank you to Dyna for finding the vast majority of the GIFs the bot uses. Additionally, Shout out to Thanos for inspiring me with his bot and being the person who got me interested in bot development.
