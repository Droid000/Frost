# Frost
A small Discord bot that helps express your feelings towards someone else.

# Installation 
You'll need to have discordrb installed on your computer. Once you've installed discordrb, you can open the main.rb file and replace the ```token:``` value with your bot's token. Make sure the bot's token value is enclosed in quotation marks. Do not ever share this token with anyone else.
